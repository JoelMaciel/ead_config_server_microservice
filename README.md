# About the project.

### TThe Microservice Config Server is a centralized service that stores the configurations 
### of various services or applications in a single place. Instead of each service maintaining
### its own configurations locally, they all consult this server to obtain the necessary 
### configuration data. It uses the Global Configuration Server (or Config Server Global Pattern)
### which is an architectural pattern used in distributed systems, especially in microservice
### environments, to centralize and manage the configurations of multiple services efficiently.


## Technology used :
-  JAVA 11 
-  SPRING CLOUD CONFIG SERVER
-  CONFIG SERVER GLOBAL PATTERN
